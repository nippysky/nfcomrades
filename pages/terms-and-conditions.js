          i. You Own the NFT. Each Comrade is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
          When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Comrade(s), the Art,
          completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart
          Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze,
          or otherwise modify the ownership of any Comrade. <br /> ii. Personal
          Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Panthart
          grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display
          the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create
          or use, solely forthe following purposes: (i) for your own personal,
          non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the
          purchase and sale of your Comrade / NFT, provided that the marketplace
          cryptographically verifies each Comrade owner’s rights to display the
          Art for their Comrade to ensure that only the actual owner can display
          the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that
          permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Comrade,
          provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each
          Comrade owner’s rights to display the Art for their Comrade to ensure
          that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the
          Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Comrade leaves the
          website/application. iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued
          compliance with these Terms, Panthart grants you an unlimited,
          worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the
          purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial
          Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the
          Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.)
          displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this
          Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a
          marketplace that permits the use and sale of Comrades generally,
          provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Comrade
          owner’s rights to display the Art for their Bored Ape to ensure that
          only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a
          third party website or application that permits the inclusion,
          involvement, or participation of Bored Apes generally, provided that
          the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each
          Comrade rights to display the Art for their Comrade to ensure that
          only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art
          is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Comrade leaves
          the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the
          foregoing.
